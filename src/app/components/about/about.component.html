                        <p>Hello! I'm Thavy, a software engineer based in Seattle, WA who enjoys building things that live on the internet. I develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive, pixel-perfect user interfaces with efficient and modern backends.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after graduating from the <a href="https://www.pugetsound.edu">University of Puget Sound</a>. I joined the research engineering team at the <a href="https://www.mda.mil">Missile Defense Agency</a> where I worked on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis that pertain to the nation's missle defense systems. I have taken a quick turn to the public sector and joined up with <a href="https://www.ibm.com">IBM</a> to help the <a href="https://www.army.mil">U.S. Army</a> on logistical data analysis using software engineering practices.</p>
                        <p class="about-content-left-tech-p">Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
